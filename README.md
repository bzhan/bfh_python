# bfh_python

For instructions on how to use the `bfh_python` program, see [the
documentation by Robert Lipshitz](https://pages.uoregon.edu/lipshitz/bfh/).

You can also install it as a self-contained [Python
package](https://packaging.python.org/) using `pip` by following [these
instructions](https://github.com/bzhan/bfh_python/tree/packaged).

The program `bfh_python` is based on a previous program (written in
Sage) by Robert Lipshitz, Peter Ozsvath and Dylan Thurston, which is
[available on the former's
webpage](https://pages.uoregon.edu/lipshitz/Code/).

Implements various algorithms described in the following papers of
R. Lipshitz, P. Ozsvath, and D. Thurston
